# worker MPM
# StartServers: initial number of server processes to start
# MinSpareThreads: minimum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# MaxSpareThreads: maximum number of worker threads which are kept spare
# ThreadLimit: ThreadsPerChild can be changed to this maximum value during a
#              graceful restart. ThreadLimit can only be changed by stopping
#              and starting Apache.
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process
# MaxClients: maximum number of simultaneous client connections
# MaxRequestsPerChild: maximum number of requests a server process serves
#
# Etherpad Lite clients create a lot of connections. To be able to support
# Several hundred concurrent users we need to make sure that we allow a few
# thousand concurrent connections. This should be ok as typical etherpad use
# involves a couple writers then a bunch of lurkers. The cost of lurkers
# is basically the TCP connection as they don't create DB writes and so on.
# In addition to allowing for connection growth, keep a healthy number of
# spare threads around to better handle thundering herds of users (eg at the
# start of summit sessions).
